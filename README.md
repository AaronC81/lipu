# lipu

This is a **heavily work-in-progress** project to create an quick, customisable, ephemeral
interface to the fantastic [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/) search tool
for Windows.

## Usage

You will need:

- Ruby - this project targets a minimum Ruby version of 2.2, due to restrictions on one of the
  machines where I'm planning to use this.
- Tk included with your Ruby distribution - this is a setting if you are using RubyInstaller
- Everything - installed and running in the background

Then, run:

```
ruby app.rb
```

## Name

lipu is the [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) word for some kind of document or
file.
